# 8x8-Animator
Animator for Adafruit 8x8 led matrices.

Adafruit 8x8 led matrices are awesome! It's a bit of a pain to program the animations though. This project is a web page created to build animations specifically for these matrices, and soecifically using Adafruit's code sample. It outputs a frame animation variable for use with code for this project:<br>

How to:<br>
1) Download<br>
2) Open Index.html in a browser

There is no file save functionality since this is running in a local web page (no access to the OS file system). Be sure to view and copy/pase your animation variable code often.
